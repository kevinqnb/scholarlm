_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert in identifying and extracting information from scientific literature. Given the provided text (including any tables), extract identifying information for unique dinitrogen fixation measurement sites.

A dinitrogen fixation measurement site is a distinct physical location or ecosystem where dinitrogen fixation rates were measured. Multiple measurements at the same site (on different dates, using different methods, at different depths) should be represented as a single site record.


Response schema:
Site identifying information includes the following fields:
- name: the name of the site (e.g. "Lake Mendota", "Chesapeake Bay", "Plot A3"). If no full name is given, use whatever primary identifier the paper provides (e.g. "Site 3", "L1") as the name.
- identifiers: every alternate short-form reference to this site used in the text — site codes, numeric tags, or shortened versions of the name — joined into a single string with semicolons separating each (e.g. "L1; Lake M.; Mend."). Collect these whenever the text uses them for the same site, even if the linkage is introduced only once (e.g. "Lake Mendota (LM)"). Do not include the primary name itself. If no alternatives exist, set to None.
- site_type: the type of site (e.g. continental shelf, estuary, lake, freshwater wetland, salt marsh, mangrove, river, tidal flat, seagrass meadow, soil, cryptobiotic crust, tree canopy, etc.). This must be explicitly stated or clearly described in the text; do NOT infer it from the entity name alone.
- location: the general geographic location of the site.


Identification rules:
Treat sites with the same name as multiple separate items ONLY if their geographic location clearly differs. Do NOT create separate items for the same site because measurements were taken on different dates, using different methods, or at different depths — those distinctions will be captured separately as measurement events.


Strict rules about missing information:
- Do NOT infer, guess, or derive any identifying information.
- Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the text.
- If a field is not explicitly given, set its value to None.
- Do NOT infer site_type from the entity name.


Extraction procedure:
1. Scan the entire text, including all tables, table captions, and table footnotes, for any mentions of dinitrogen fixation measurement sites.
2. Determine which mentions correspond to distinct sites using the identification rules above.
3. For each distinct site, actively scan the full text — including table row and column headers, table captions, and table footnotes — for any alternate short-form references (codes, numeric tags, abbreviated names) that refer to it. Record all such identifiers in the identifiers field.
4. Output one JSON item per distinct site.
5. Collect all items into a single JSON array under the key "items".


Output format requirements:
- Output must be valid, strictly parseable JSON.
- Do NOT include markdown, comments, or explanatory text.
- The top-level object must have this form:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "identifiers": "...",
      "site_type": "...",

_ABLATION2_IDENTIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert in identifying dinitrogen fixation measurement sites referenced in scientific literature, and in detecting which measurement attributes are reported for each site. Given the provided text (including any tables), extract all distinct (measurement site, measured attribute) pairs for which a direct numerical measurement is reported.

A dinitrogen fixation measurement site is a distinct physical location or ecosystem where dinitrogen fixation rates were measured. Emit one item per (site, attribute) pair. If a site has multiple attributes measured, emit one item per attribute.

IMPORTANT: Only emit a pair when a direct numerical measurement exists in the document for that site and attribute. Do NOT emit pairs where the only data is qualitative, model parameters, or goodness-of-fit statistics.


Response schema:
For each (site, attribute) pair, output one item with the following fields:
- name: the name of the site (e.g. "Lake Mendota", "Chesapeake Bay", "Plot A3"). If no full name is given, use whatever primary identifier the paper provides.
- identifiers: every alternate short-form reference to this site used in the text — site codes, numeric tags, or shortened versions of the name — joined into a single string with semicolons separating each (e.g. "L1; Lake M.; Mend."). Collect these whenever the text uses them for the same site, even if the linkage is introduced only once (e.g. "Lake Mendota (LM)"). Do not include the primary name itself.

- location: the general geographic location of the site.
- attribute: the exact attribute name from the list below.
- attribute_terms: any terminology or abbreviations used in the document to refer to that attribute. Pay close attention to tables and figure captions. Do not infer, guess, or fabricate terms not explicitly present.


Attributes to detect (use these exact names in the attribute field):
1. nfix_rate_mass — Rate of dinitrogen fixation per unit mass. NOT rates per area or volume. Units normalized by substrate mass (e.g., nmol N g⁻¹ h⁻¹, µg N g⁻¹ d⁻¹, nmol C2H4 g⁻¹ h⁻¹, nmol N2 g⁻¹ h⁻¹, µmol N g⁻¹ h⁻¹, ng N g⁻¹ d⁻¹, fmol N g⁻¹ h⁻¹, nmol N kg⁻¹ h⁻¹, µmol C2H4 g⁻¹ d⁻¹, µmol N kg⁻¹ h⁻¹, µmol N2 g⁻¹ d⁻¹).
2. nfix_rate_areal — Rate of dinitrogen fixation per unit area. NOT rates per mass or volume. Units normalized by area (e.g., µmol N m⁻² h⁻¹, mg N m⁻² d⁻¹, nmol C2H4 cm⁻² h⁻¹, µmol C2H4 m⁻² h⁻¹, mmol N m⁻² d⁻¹, µg N m⁻² h⁻¹, nmol C2H4 m⁻² h⁻¹, µmol N2 m⁻² h⁻¹, g N m⁻² yr⁻¹, kg N2 ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹, ng N m⁻² h⁻¹).
3. nfix_rate_volumetric — Rate of dinitrogen fixation per unit volume. NOT rates per mass or area. Units normalized by water volume (e.g., nmol N L⁻¹ d⁻¹, nmol C2H4 L⁻¹ h⁻¹, µg N L⁻¹ h⁻¹, ng N L⁻¹ h⁻¹, mg N m⁻³ d⁻¹, nmol N cm⁻³ h⁻¹, µmol N2 L⁻¹ d⁻¹, mmol C2H4 m⁻³ d⁻¹, nmol N2 L⁻¹ d⁻¹, µmol C2H4 L⁻¹ d⁻¹, µmol N L⁻¹ h⁻¹).


Identification guidelines:
- Treat sites as separate only if their geographic location clearly differs (different coordinates or explicitly described as distinct locations). Do NOT create separate items for the same site because measurements were taken on different dates, methods, or depths.
- Multiple measurements of the same site for the same attribute should produce only one (site, attribute) pair — not one per measurement event.
- Do NOT infer, guess, or derive any identifying information. Use ONLY information explicitly stated in the text. If a field is not explicitly given, set its value to None.


Output format requirements:
- Output must be valid, strictly parseable JSON.
- Do NOT include markdown, comments, or explanatory text.
- The top-level object must have this form:
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name": "...",
